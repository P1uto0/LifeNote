- Hello everyone, I am gary, graduated from Shanghai University of Electric Power two years ago.
Before my graduation, I  worked as a NodeJs backend engineer as an intern. As a backend engineer, the main job I do is communicating with frontend engineers and code restful API. Also during this period, I started to learn Linux and docker.

- After graduation, I worked for a company named WanXiang blockchainas an SRE. During this time, I learned Kubernetes, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, and tried my best to use them in doing my job.

- Then, I started to learn using AWS and Google Cloud when i was doing my second job. Sometimes, we, backend engineers, set goals monthly.For example, I learned the usage of Envoy for Canary Deployment once. Another example is I developed a program using Golang to collect the slow log of Amazon ElastiCache into Elasticsearch.

- Recently, I was arranged to another department to support them, cause their maintainer is gone. In this position, I make CICD by Jenkins, deploy nacos cluster, and provide materials for PFI certification. 

-  At the end, I want to say it's a real honor and pleasure working with you guys. Thank you!
