I am gary. I graduated from Shanghai University of Electric Power in 2019 and majored in  Management Information System.
During my internship, I once worked as a NodeJs backend engineer. We communicated with frontend engineers and code restful API. I started to learn Linux and docker from that time.
After graduation I worked as an SRE in WanXiang blockchain company, I started to learn Kubernetes, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, and use them in working.
In my second job, I started to learn the usage of AWS and Google Cloud, and use them in working. Sometimes, we have a small goal every month, for example, I once learned the usage of Envoy for Canary Deployment; developed a program using Golang to collect the slow log of Amazon ElastiCache into Elasticsearch.
Recently, I was sent to another department to support because the maintainer had gone. Made CICD by Jenkins, deployed nacos cluster, providing materials for PFI certification.
That's all.
